# Start Here: Project Consistency & Quality Checklist

Before actioning any prompt, feature, or code change, **please review this file and all referenced documentation** to ensure you are:

1. **Staying True to the Overall Goals**
   - Review `/docs/project-brief.md` for the application's vision, goals, and architectural principles.
   - Ensure your work aligns with the intended user experience, business logic, and technical direction.

2. **Preserving Previous Work**
   - Check `/docs/dev-plan.md` for the current modular development plan and completed modules.
   - Confirm you are not overwriting or duplicating solutions to problems already addressed.
   - Review `/docs/update-log.md` for recent decisions, changes, and rationale.

3. **Optimizing for Future Cost and Maintainability**
   - Make choices that minimize future hosting, compute, and maintenance costs.
   - Prefer scalable, modular, and well-documented solutions.
   - Avoid introducing unnecessary dependencies or vendor lock-in.

**Checklist Before You Begin:**
- [ ] Have you read `/docs/project-brief.md`?
- [ ] Have you reviewed `/docs/dev-plan.md` for current priorities and structure?
- [ ] Have you checked `/docs/update-log.md` for recent changes or context?
- [ ] Are you following best practices for cost, scalability, and maintainability?
- [ ] Are you timestamping (date and time) all updates to documentation and logs for traceability?

**Best Practice:**
- All updates to documentation and logs **must** include both the date and time (timestamp) of the change. This ensures clear traceability and accountability for all project changes.

**If in doubt, ask for clarification or propose your approach before making major changes.**
